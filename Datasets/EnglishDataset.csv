"Teaching things in a fun and easy manner is what motives the viewers ; which is exactly what you do. It's one of the most key points of learning a language - making it fun. Now, most people can teach English but it's the technique that's important. I've seen you quite a few times before and damn I can tell you're experienced! It's honestly quite rare, to say the least, to see highly educated people teaching English through social media in Bangladesh as most of them have jobs focusing on certain institutions. By making content online, you're not only helping people educate themselves but also to save money. It's some a lot of people struggle with. I'm truly amazed by your capabilities of teaching. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ! <3",positive

You have to solve it LAYER BY LAYER and NOT COLOR BY COLOR 3. You don‚Äôt have to touch the yellow color throughout the solve. You can just find it later on, its not like u r colorblind 4. DUDE WHY WOULD YOU JUST MAKE A VIDEO ONLY FOR 1 SIDE YOU CAN JUST MAKE AN ENTIRE VIDEO ON HOW TO SOLVE IT. THERE ARE EVEN BETTER AND EASIER WAYS YOU CAN SOLVE IT. I RECOMMEND DON'T FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL There are J Perm, TheCubicle and many more channels Go watch their turorials They can make u understand how to solve the entire cube in 14 minutes, not like this guy who just solved 1 side in 14 minutes",negative
